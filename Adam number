Sample Test Case:

Input:

12

Output:

 True

Explanation:

Square of 12 = 144

Reverse of 12 = 21

Square of 21 = 441

Now Square of 12 and square of the reverse of 12 are the reverse of each other. Therefore 12 is Adam number.

Input: 

14

Output:

 False

Explanation:
 Square of 14 = 196

Reverse of 14 = 41

Square of 41 = 1681

Now Square of 14 and square of the reverse of 14 are not the reverse of each other. Therefore 14 is Not  Adam number.
